'''
Create a PostgreSQL database using Replit's built-in database functionality. Define a table called "students" with columns for student ID, name, and age.

Write a Python script in Replit that connects to the PostgreSQL database, inserts a new student record, and queries the database to retrieve student information.

Use pytest test cases to validate the functionality of your PostgreSQL interactions.
